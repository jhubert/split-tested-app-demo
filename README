== Split Testing Application Demo

This is a demo of the split testing code that I wrote for doing split testing in a rails application with Google Analytics as your dashboard.

The code quality isn't as high as I would like and it basically just works. I am in the process of abstracting the necessary pieces and turning it into a gem.

The files that you will want to look at right now are:
  app/controllers/application_controller.rb
  config/initializers/split_testing.rb
  config/split_tests.yml
  test/split/test1/
